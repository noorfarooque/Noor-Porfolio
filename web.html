        <h3>Web Development- Introduction</h3> 

        <p>Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private network known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality.

        From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps, from ecommerce websites to content management systems (CMS); all the tools we use via the internet on a daily basis have been built by web developers.

        </p>

        <p>
            Web development can be broken down into three layers: client-side coding (frontend), server-side coding (backend) and database technology.
